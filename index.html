	  		<p class="center_text">
	  		As stated before I am a business school student. I've always been pretty curious by nature, to an extent where I could picture a happy self in almost every realm of human endeavor. So the choice was hard but I figured that a business school would open more doors than it would close.

	  	<h2 class="font_design2 center_text">A Music Maniac</h2>
	  		<p class="center_text">
	  		Music is probably one of the most important things in my life. I cannot picture my existence without it. I am a huge listener of many different kinds of genre and I've been singing in a chore for ten years now. Truly mankind best invention !

	  	<div class="framing_black softened_design">
	  	<h2 class="font_design2 center_text">A Bit Of Nerd</h2>
	  		<p class="center_text">
	  		Some detractors might not approve this part of me. Seeing it as REPULSIVE or ABHORRENT, but I am not one to bow down before critic! Drama put aside I truly am a gamer. My brother is too. Hell, even my father plays videogames. I truly believe it to be a form of Art as it now constitute huge part of modern pop-culture.
